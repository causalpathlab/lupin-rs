//! Local, root-free branch structure of the centroid MST — the substrate for the
//! root-invariant sibling-branch association test (`senna dyn-assoc`).
//!
//! The instability of pseudotime-based matching comes from committing to a single
//! global **root**. A **junction** (a node where the tree diverges) is instead a
//! *local* feature: on the undirected MST it is any node of degree ≥ 3, and the
//! subtrees meeting there are **sibling branches** — the alternative fates — no matter
//! where the root is. Removing a junction `J` splits the tree into `deg(J)` components;
//! each is one branch off `J`. Every node is then assigned to its **nearest** junction,
//! the branch it sits on relative to that junction, and its graph **distance** from it —
//! `(junction, sibling_branch, dist_from_junction)`. `dist_from_junction` is the local,
//! root-invariant axis cells are matched on (replacing global pseudotime).
//!
//! The velocity orientation ([`super::orient::directed_edges`]) is kept only as an
//! annotation: a branch is `downstream` (a diverging fate) when its incident edge points
//! away from the junction, else it is the `upstream` trunk / shared context. Nothing here
//! depends on a root existing.
