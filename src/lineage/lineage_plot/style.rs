//! Graphic parameters for `lupin lineage-plot` — every colour, stroke, alpha and size
//! decision lives here, so `run_lineage_plot.rs` only decides *what* to draw.
//!
//! The rule this file exists to enforce: nothing below reaches for the data, and
//! nothing in `run_lineage_plot.rs` hard-codes a pixel or an RGB triple. Tuning the figure
//! means editing one file; changing what the figure *means* means editing the other.
//!
//! Sizes are expressed relative to something that moves with the figure — the
//! canvas's short side, or the cell-point radius (itself derived from
//! `--point-size` and `--dpi`) — never as bare pixels, so `--width` / `--height` /
//! `--dpi` scale the whole composition instead of just the raster layers.
