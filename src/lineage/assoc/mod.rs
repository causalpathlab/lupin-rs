//! `lupin dyn-assoc` — modality dynamics along the lineage.
//!
//! Downstream of `lupin lineage` (mirrors `gem -> annotate --method projection`): the trajectory is fit
//! once; `assoc` then asks two complementary questions per modality site, with
//! coverage n = edited+unedited as the binomial denominator (so detection bias is
//! conditioned out) and the branches taken from gem θ + velocity with the modality
//! held out (so neither test double-dips):
//!
//! - **Between branches** ([`contrast`]) — the counterfactual *if a cell had gone
//!   down a different branch, would its rate differ?*, comparing branches at matched
//!   pseudotime (tradeSeq `patternTest`, cocoa matched-null spirit).
//! - **Along a branch** ([`trend`]) — *does the rate change as the branch
//!   progresses?*, a binomial/quasi-binomial spline GAM of `logit(k/n)` on pseudotime
//!   (tradeSeq `associationTest`).
